Based on the provided information, I will create a simple reinforcement learning model using PyTorch. The model will be a Deep Q-Network (DQN) that takes the state as input and outputs Q-values for each possible action. The state will include the current opened position, running profit, and the sticks.iloc[i] data. The actions will be Buy (Long), Sell (Short), and Hold (No position).

Core classes and functions:
1. DQN - The Deep Q-Network model class
2. ReplayMemory - A class to store and sample experiences for training
3. train() - A function to train the DQN model
4. select_action() - A function to select an action based on the current state and the DQN model
5. optimize_model() - A function to optimize the DQN model using the experiences from ReplayMemory

Now, I will provide the content of each file including all the code.
